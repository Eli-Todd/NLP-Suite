## What is NLP Suite

In an age of BIG DATA, the purpose of the suite is rather to provide humanists and social scientists a wide range of **computational tools for the analysis and visualization of smaller datasets,** the more typical datasets humanists and social scientists use (e.g., the works of one Nobel Prize winner, a handful of in-depth interviews, a few thousand newspaper articles).

Furthermore, the NLP suite is designed for non-specialists, for scholars with **no knowledge or little knowledge of Natural Language Processing.**

The NLP Suite was developed by **Roberto Franzosi** at **Emory University** with the help of many current and past **Emory undergraduate students**: Matthew Chau, Jian Chen, Wei Dai, Wenqin Dong, Yilin Dong, Yuhang Feng, Jack Hester, Ziyang Hu, Hang Jiang, Josh Karol, Brett Landau, Rafael Piloto, Ishan Saran, Gabriel Wang, Yi Wang, Angel Xie, Catherine Xie, Doris Zhou.
