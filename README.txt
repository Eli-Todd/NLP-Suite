NLP Suite

Once you have downloaded and installed the NLP Suite, anywhere on your machine, goto the setup_Mac or setup_Windows folder (depending upon your machine) and run STEP1 (to install Anaconda) and STEP2 (to install Python and all Python and Java files in the NLP Suite). Also read the readme_Mac.txt or readme_Windows.txt (again, depending upon your machine) for further instructions.

**For more information on the NLP Suite, please visit the Wiki NLP Suite GitHub pages at https://github.com/NLP-Suite/NLP-Suite/wiki.**
