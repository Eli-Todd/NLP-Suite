*,NLP Suite reminders,Several NLP Suite scripts will fire up reminders for the user. You can turn them off once you are familiar with a script. You can always turn any reminder back ON (or OFF for that matter) if you select the reminders dropdown menu at the bottom of each GUI and then select a specific reminder (if reminders are available for that GUI).,Yes,OFF
*,Input/Output configurations,"Most GUIs in the NLP Suite provide two types of Input/Output (I/O) configurations that specify your selection for your input file or directory (these are MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE. YOU CAN ONLY HAVE ONE OR THE OTHER BUT NOT BOTH) and output directory:

  Default I/O configuration
 GUI-specific I/O configuration

The Default I/O configuration applies to ALL GUIs in the NLP Suite. This is an ideal option if you work exclusively, or mostly, with the same input file(s) regardless of GUI (i.e., NLP algorithms); you would not need to select these options for every GUI.

If you occasionally need to run a script using a different set of I/O options, setup theGUI-specific I/O configuration. This will not affect your I/O selections for all GUIs and will only apply to a specific GUI if you chose the menu optionGUI-specific I/O configuration.",No,OFF
NLP_default_IO,NLP Suite architecture & filenames,"The Python scripts in the NLP Suite have filenames that clearly identify the Suite architecture.

The filename suffix designates two different types of files: _main and _util.

_main files are the only ones that you can run in command line independently of others; they may call _util files.

The _main files, with their GUI options, lay out on the screen the widgets of a script for easy Graphical User Interface (GUI).

ALL SCRIPTS SUFFIXED BY _main CAN BE RUN INDIPENDENTLY OF THE NLP SUITE. Thus on command line you can type
Python knowledge_graphs_main.py
and it will fire up the annotator GUI independently of NLP_main.py.

The filename prefix cluster together scripts used for the same purpose. Thus annotator identifies all files dealing with html annotation.",Yes,OFF
SVO,SVO output,"The SVO pipeline will create in output an SVO subdirectory inside the main output directory.

Depending upon the options you select it will also create different subdirectories (e.g., GIS, WordNet) inside the SVO subdirectory. Contrary to this, the creference resolution option will create a subdirectory inside the main output directory rather than the SVO subdirectory, since coreferenced files can then be used as input to any NLP algorithms.

Depending upon the options you select, the SVO pipeline will produce different types of files: cvf files, wordcloud image, Google Earth Pro map, and Gephi network graph.

While cvf and png files are easy to read, less so are Google Earth Pro kml files and, particularly, Gephi gexf files.

More to the point, Stanford CoreNLP's performance deteriorates with sentences with more that 70/100 words.

You should run the algorithm that extracts all sentences from a corpus and computes sentence length. This will allow you to either edit the sentence manually or perhaps run the algorithm that will add full stops (.) to sentences without end-of-sentence markers (too many sentences of this kind, one after the other, can create unduly long sentences).
